## In Plain Language

In this project, we ask whether companies that perform better on sustainability are also better able to cope with crises.  
We look at firms’ sustainability performance before crises and compare how they fare during disruptive periods, focusing on indicators of financial resilience.  
Our findings suggest that companies with stronger sustainability performance tend to be more resilient when facing crises, supporting the idea that sustainability can contribute to long-term stability and risk management.

## Paper Highlight
| # | Why it matters | What the paper delivers |
|---|---------------|-------------------------|
| **1** | **Direct accounting‑based proof that “sustainability pays” in a pandemic.** Prior COVID‑19 studies stopped at the stock‑market level; investors care about fundamentals. | Links higher sustainability scores to stronger **ROA** and **ROE** during 2020, showing real balance‑sheet resilience rather than short‑term market noise. |
| **2** | **Two‑crisis comparison, one narrative.** Most work isolates a single downturn, leaving managers guessing whether findings generalize. | Compares the 2007‑08 financial crisis with COVID‑19, revealing when sustainability helps (COVID) and when it hurts (2007‑08), and why. |
| **3** | **New contingency insight: _mature_ sustainability is the real shield.** Firms often wonder whether early ESG efforts are enough. | Shows that only **mature** adopters enjoy “insurance‑like” protection; early‑stage programs do not. Also confirms a **bidirectional** link—sustainability both drives and is driven by profits. |
| **4** | **Truly global evidence.** ESG debates can be US‑centric. | Analyzes **2,885 firms across all G7 economies (2004‑2020)**, underscoring worldwide relevance. |
| **5** | **Rigorous, policy‑ready methodology.** Decision‑makers look for robustness. | Employs simultaneous‑equation 3SLS and Heckman selection tests to control endogeneity and disclosure bias, strengthening causal claims. |

## Managerial Takeaways
- **Commit for the long haul—mature sustainability programs pay off.** Early-stage or PR-driven initiatives yield limited cushioning, whereas seasoned programs deliver “insurance-like” protection when shocks hit. 
- **Think years, not quarters.** Benefits accrue slowly; managers who persevere through crisis noise ultimately see risk reduction and stronger ROI. 
- **Avoid greenwashing.** Superficial campaigns risk reputational blow-back from increasingly savvy stakeholders and squander long-term gains. 
- **Treat sustainability as strategic insurance.** During supply-side shutdowns such as COVID-19, high-scoring firms preserved revenue while laggards were forced to close or lost customers. 
- **Crisis type matters.** Demand-led shocks (2007-08) can temporarily penalize high-cost, sustainability-focused firms, yet the same firms rebound faster post-crisis; supply-led shocks (COVID-19) reward them immediately. 
- **Embed sustainability in core operations and stakeholder dialogue.** Firms that integrate ESG into core opertions are better positioned to meet shifting societal norms and regulatory scrutiny.
