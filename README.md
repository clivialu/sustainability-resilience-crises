## In plain language

In this project, we ask whether companies that perform better on sustainability are also better able to cope with crises.  
We look at firms’ sustainability performance before crises and compare how they fare during disruptive periods, focusing on indicators of financial resilience.  
Our findings suggest that companies with stronger sustainability performance tend to be more resilient when facing crises, supporting the idea that sustainability can contribute to long-term stability and risk management.
